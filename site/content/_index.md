    「獨木舟是愛與感恩」——莉子姐

    莉子姐來自椰油部落，17歲台北打拼，繞了一圈回來家鄉，做著小攤販獨木舟飲料店，小時候莉子姐的家人以手工藝『獨木舟』維生，一艘艘獨木舟不只帶給遊客回憶，也承載對家庭愛與關懷，現在莉子姐想用『獨木舟』傳承下去，將這份感動帶給來蘭嶼的旅人。

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
